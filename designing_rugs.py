'''Write a function that accepts the height and width (m, n) and an optional proc s and generates a list with m elements. Each element is a string consisting of either:

    The default character (hash #) repeating n times (if no proc is given).
    The character passed in through the proc repeating n times.

Examples

make_rug(3, 5, '#') âžž [
  "#####",
  "#####",
  "#####"
]'''

def make_rug(m, n, s):
    rug=[n*s for i in range(m)]

    return rug

print(make_rug(3, 5, '#'))
