"""Two matrices must have an equal number of rows and columns to be subtracted. In which case, the subtracted of two matrices A and B will be a matrix which has the same number of rows and columns as A and B.
The result of the subtraction of A and B, denoted A - B is computed by subtracting corresponding elements of A and B.
Create a function that takes 2 x 2D lists lst1 and lst2 as an argument and returns a 2D list (matrix C). C = A-B.
